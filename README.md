## 📌 Description  

This project is a recreation of the classic Tetris game, focusing on real-time gameplay, collision detection, and user input handling. It was developed as a fun way to improve my programming skills and understand game mechanics.  

### 💛 Motivation  
Tetris is a timeless game that challenges players' spatial awareness and reaction speed. Developing it from scratch provided valuable insights into game development concepts.  

### 🎯 Why this project?  
Building Tetris was an opportunity to practice real-time game logic, UI responsiveness, and player interaction. My goal was to create a functional and enjoyable version of the game.  

### ✅ What problem does it solve?  
It provides an interactive way to experience game development while offering an engaging puzzle-solving challenge.  

### 💡 What I learned  
- How to implement **real-time keyboard controls**  
- How to handle **collision detection and physics**  
- How to manage **game states** (running, paused, game over)  
- How to create an efficient **scoring system**
